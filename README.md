# Portrait Helper

**Portrait Helper** allows you to save and load portrait presets, edit camera and pose settings in detail.

Portrait Helper opens automatically when you edit a portrait. It's a small bar at the top of the window.

This plugin is hopefully soon available in the Dalamud plugin repository!
